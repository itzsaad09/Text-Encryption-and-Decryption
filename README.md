# Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Program

This repository contains an 8086 assembly language program that implements the Caesar Cipher technique for encrypting and decrypting text.

## Features
- **Encryption:** Encrypts a given string using a user-defined key.
- **Decryption:** Decrypts an encrypted string back to its original form using the same key.
- **User-Friendly Menu:** Provides a simple menu for choosing between encryption, decryption, or exiting the program.
- **Case Preservation:** Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, preserving their original case.
- **Non-Alphabetic Character Handling:** Non-alphabetic characters (numbers, symbols, spaces) are copied as is without modification.

## How it Works (Caesar Cipher)
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It's a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a right shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on.

In this program:
- The KEY determines the shift value.
- For encryption, the key is added to the character's alphabetical position (modulo 26 for wrap-around).
- For decryption, the key is subtracted from the character's alphabetical position (modulo 26 for wrap-around, handling negative results by adding 26).

## Requirements
- EMU 8086
- MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)
- DOSBox (for running the compiled executable in a DOS environment)

## Code Structure
The Project.asm file is structured into the following main sections:
1. .MODEL SMALL, .STACK 100H, .DATA, .CODE: Standard assembly program setup.
2. **Data Segment (.DATA):** Defines messages, input/output buffers, and variables for string length and key.
3. **Code Segment (.CODE):**
   - **MAIN PROC:** The main procedure that displays the menu and calls the respective encryption/decryption routines based on user input.
   - **INPUT_STRING PROC:** Handles user input for the string to be processed and the encryption/decryption key.
   - **ENCRYPT PROC:** Implements the Caesar cipher encryption logic. It iterates through the input string, shifts alphabetic characters by the KEY value, and stores the result.
   - **DECRYPT PROC:** Implements the Caesar cipher decryption logic, reversing the encryption process.
   - **DISPLAY_RESULT PROC:** Displays the final encrypted or decrypted string.
